**Postman Hacks in Java and Apache Kafka**

## Inspiration

I wanted to participate on this Postman hackathon challenge in order to build my own corporation based on technical skills such as Java and Apache Kafka.

## What it does

The Spring Boot app communicates to an open API for meetups with popular software technologies such as Spring Boot (Java) framework and Apache Kafka.

## How we built it

I have built it with Spring Boot (Java) framework and Apache Kafka.

## Challenges we ran into

The challenge that I ran into was to handle all the available responses with the powerful tool that is Postman.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The combination of Java and Kafka frameworks.

## What we learned

I have already learned if someone believes on any project idea, he/she can definitely implement it.

## What's next for Postman Hacks in Java and Apache Kafka

I will work on this project until to build an entire company based on these type of technologies.
